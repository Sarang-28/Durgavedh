    <p ><b>Shri. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>, the revered founder of the Maratha Empire,
         was a visionary leader whose deep love for forts played a crucial role in shaping his military strategies. 
        He understood that forts were not merely structures of stone but the very backbone of Swarajya (self-rule). His devotion to fortification
         led to the construction and reinforcement of over 300 forts across Maharashtra, each serving as a symbol of strength, resilience, and 
         strategic brilliance. From the formidable Raigad Fort, where he was crowned, to the invincible Sinhagad and Pratapgad, Shivaji Maharaj
          ensured that these forts became impenetrable strongholds against enemy forces. His guerrilla warfare tactics, known as Ganimi Kava,
           relied heavily on the terrain and fortifications, allowing his army to outmaneuver much larger adversaries. Beyond their military 
           importance, these forts stood as monuments of Maratha pride, reflecting his unwavering commitment to protecting his people and culture.
            Even today, the forts of Maharashtra echo the legacy of Shivaji Maharaj, inspiring generations with tales of valor, sacrifice, 
            and the undying spirit of Swarajya. His deep respect and strategic use of these forts remain a testament to his unparalleled leadership
             and love for the land.</p>
